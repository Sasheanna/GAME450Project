# Base System Functionality

## System scenarios

The AI system can handle the below scenarios:


# Prompt Engineering and Model Parameter Choice

## Rationale behind temperature, max tokens, and other parameters
Write rationale here

# Tools Usage
Uses tool calls if necessary
 - Dice rolls 
 - Purchasing goods
 - Accessing json data

# Planning and Reasoning
Coherent conversation and chain-of-thought models used (or something like that)

# RAG Implementation

Retrieval-augmented approach to maintain lore or context

# Additional Tools/Innovation

Use at least one creative or optional add-on (some examples are text-to-speech or NPC image generation)

# Code Quality and Modular Design

Good coding and version control practices

# To-do

- Other NPC templates
- Prompt engineer to improve the DM *
- Implement tool calls
    - Dice roll
    - Access player data
    - Purcahse items  
- Progress system
    - Might involve RAG?
- Basic combat system
    - Maybe use dictionary?
    - Maybe use RAG?
- NPC image generation
    - Has to get from external image generator
- Player sheet created on first session
    - Stored somewhere (json), AI *cannot* modify.
