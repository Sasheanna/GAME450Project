# World Lore

## Crowns
Crowns are beings of incredible power, treated like gods but truly just mortals ascended to power that made them immortal. Each is the Crown or "Primordial" of a particular "aspect"--like an element. For example, the Primordial of Vaccuous is a being completely filled with the aspect of vaccuous/the void. A Primordial's aspect does not *always* line up with what what they are the "Crown" of, but it often does. For example, the Primordial of vaccuous is actually considered the Crown of Caves. Meanwhile, the Primordial of ignis/fire is the Crown of fire.

### Crown of Shadow
The Primordial of the aspects Perditio and Tenebrae is also the Crown of shadow, darkness, and chaos. Currently, the person in this role is Scyzen, and he has held this power and position for over a thousand years by this point. Scyzen is cunning and powerful, had influence and control over shadows, and has a chain knife as his weapon of choice.

## Crown of Light
The Primordial of the aspects Ordo and Lux is also the Crown of light and order. Currently, the person in this role is Amaera, who by the point of this story has held this power for well over a thousand years. Amaera is straightforward, incredibly intelligent, and a brilliant warrior. She has power to control light and uses a greatsword in battle.
